# `00` Welcome 

We are very excited to have you here! 🎉 😂

Being a Machine Learning developer without Pandas is like being a handyman without a hammer. Why would you put yourself through that hustle?

> Pandas has so many benefits that we don't have enough time to list them all, so here are just a few:

1. Data representation: this helps to analyze and understand data better. Simpler data = better results.

2. Less writing and more work done.

3. An extensive set of features: analyze your data, data filtering, or segmenting and segregating the data according to preference, etc.

4. Efficiently handles large data: saves a lot of time by importing large amounts of data very quickly.

5. Makes data flexible and customizable: customize, edit and pivot. Get the most out of your data.

## 💬 Fundamentals:

+ How to install Pandas.

+ To download the Dataset.

+ How to create a series.
