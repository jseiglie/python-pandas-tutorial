# Pandas for machine learning

Pandas is the best and most popular [Python](https://4geeks.com/lesson/intro-to-python) library for machine learning. This library offers a wide variety of functions that will help you manipulate data, optimize your machine-learning algorithm, and much more. This tutorial will help you to get familiar with this library and master the most used functionalities with code samples and video tutorials that will help you to create your first data frame, clean a dataset of information, read CSV files, etc... 

The exercises in this tutorial have been created after about 60 hours of development by many experts in machine learning and carefully reviewed by our [contributors](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/python-functions-programming-exercises/graphs/contributors) to make sure you have the most accurate and important information that will help you start your machine learning career.

## Tutorial Installation

There are two ways to initialize this tutorial, the first and easiest is to open the tutorial in a cloud environment such as **Codespaces** or **Gitpod**, and the second is to clone this repository in your local environment.

> We recommend that you use **Codespaces** because it is the easiest and fastest way to start the tutorial.

### 1. Open the tutorial in a cloud environment

You can start this tutorial in just a few seconds with **Codespaces** by clicking on the following link: [open in codespaces](https://codespaces.new/?repo=4GeeksAcademy/python-pandas-tutorial) (recommended), or you can use **Gitpod** by clicking on: [open in gitpod](https://gitpod.io#https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/python-pandas-tutorial).

> Once you have opened the cloud environment, either **Codespaces** or **Gitpod**, the LearnPack exercises should start automatically. If the exercises do not start automatically you can open a terminal and type the command: `learnpack start`

### 2. Open the tutorial in your local environment

To start this tutorial in your local environment, follow the steps below:

1.  Open a terminal and clone this repository on your local environment. You can use the following command: 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/python-pandas-tutorial.git 
```

2. Make sure you have installed a Node.js version of `12.01.1` or higher:

```bash
node --version
```

3. Install LearnPack, the package manager for learning tutorials, and also run the Python compiler plugin for LearnPack. You can do this with the following commands:
 
```bash
> npm i learnpack -g
> learnpack plugins:install learnpack-python
```

4. Finally, Install Jest to perform the necessary tests throughout the tutorial and start the exercises with the following commands:

```bash
> npm i jest@24.8.0 -g
> learnpack start
```
